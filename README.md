# jwt_tutorial
A tutorial to demonstrate how to secure a Node.js Express API with JSON Web Tokens

## Usage

This repository contains two folders:

* tutorial_example contains a basic Express API application that you can use to run through the tutorial.

* complete_example contains the working finished example that you can use to compare to your code or work
through the tutorial with an already completed example.

For both folders you need to run `$ npm install` to download the required dependendies
and then run `$ node app.js` to run the application itself. Then it will be available at
`http://localhost:8080`
